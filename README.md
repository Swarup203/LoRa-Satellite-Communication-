# Antenna

To ensure optimal reception and transmission for the ground station, a properly tuned antenna is crucial. For this project, we recommend designing and using a **¬º-wave ground-plane antenna**. The steps involve both setting up the embedded system with the TinyGS firmware and tuning the antenna using a **nanoVNA** (Vector Network Analyzer) for precise measurements.

### Steps:
1. **Install and setup TinyGS firmware** on the ESP32-LoRa embedded system:
   - Follow the steps to install the TinyGS firmware, which enables the ESP32 to communicate with satellites and function as a LoRa ground station.
   - Ensure the ESP32 is properly connected to the LoRa module (SX1278) and all configurations are correct.

2. **Antenna design**:
   - Design a **¬º-wave ground-plane antenna**, ideal for the 433 MHz frequency used by LoRa.
   - The antenna length can be calculated using the formula: 
   **Formula**:
     `L = 300 / (4 * Frequency)`
      
   Where:
   - `L` is the length of the antenna in meters.
   - `Frequency` is the operating frequency in MHz.
   - 300 is the speed of light in a vacuum (in megahertz * meters).

## For example, for a frequency of 433 MHz:
 Explanation:
 Wavelength (Œª) of a radio wave is the distance it travels in one cycle and is given by 
 ùúÜ=ùëê/ùëì,
 where 
 c is the speed of light and 
 f is the frequency

### For a LoRa system operating at 433 MHz:

  L= 300 / (4 x 433)
  L‚âà (300 / 1732) = **0.173¬†meters** = **17.3¬†cm**
‚Äã

3. **Antenna tuning**:
   - Use a **nanoVNA** to tune the antenna for minimum **SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)**, ensuring it resonates well at the desired frequency.
   - Adjust the radials and main element length as needed to achieve a good match and reduce loss during signal transmission and reception.

### Radiation Pattern of a Dipole Antenna

The radiation pattern of a dipole antenna is crucial for understanding its performance in different directions. A standard half-wave dipole antenna radiates energy in a **doughnut-shaped pattern**, with the strongest radiation occurring perpendicular to the axis of the antenna.

     <img src="doc/images/Radiation_pattern.gif" width="600">
     </p>
     
#### Key Characteristics:
- **Omnidirectional in the horizontal plane**: The dipole antenna radiates equally in all directions along the horizontal plane, making it effective for long-range communication in all directions.
- **Minimal radiation at the ends**: Along the axis of the dipole (at the tips), the radiation is weakest, meaning that the antenna's performance is reduced in the directions along its length.
- **Figure-eight pattern**: When viewed from the side, the radiation pattern resembles a figure-eight shape, with the strongest lobes perpendicular to the antenna.

This pattern makes dipole antennas ideal for ground station setups where coverage in all horizontal directions is needed, but the vertical direction is less critical.

# Full-Duplex Communication Using RadioLib and Custom SPI in LoRa Subsystems

By utilizing **RadioLib** and a **custom SPI** setup, we can create an efficient communication channel between two LoRa subsystems. Although LoRa technology is designed for half-duplex operation, we can simulate full-duplex communication by rapidly switching between transmit and receive modes.

#### Custom SPI Pin Configuration:
For the ESP32, we define custom SPI pins to interface with the SX1278 LoRa module:

- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: GPIO 27  
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: GPIO 19  
- **SCK (Serial Clock)**: GPIO 5  
- **NSS (Chip Select)**: GPIO 18  
- **RST (Reset)**: GPIO 14  
- **DIO0 (Interrupt)**: GPIO 26  
- **DIO1 (Optional for better reception)**: GPIO 32

This custom SPI setup ensures reliable communication between the ESP32 and the LoRa transceiver, allowing us to manage data transmission and reception efficiently.

#### Optimized Setup for Communication:
1. **Hardware Configuration**:
   - Two ESP32 boards, each connected to an SX1278 LoRa module using the custom SPI pinout listed above.
   - The nodes alternate between transmitting and receiving, simulating a full-duplex channel with minimal delay.

2. **Efficient Data Transmission**:
   - Using **RadioLib**, the LoRa nodes are dynamically switched between `startTransmit()` and `startReceive()` functions, enabling near real-time communication with low latency.
   - **Collision Avoidance**: By controlling timing between the two nodes, packet collisions are avoided, ensuring smooth data flow.

3. **Performance and Power Optimization**:
   - **Minimal Latency**: The fast switching between transmit and receive ensures continuous data flow with almost no lag.
   - **Error Handling**: Features like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) guarantee data integrity even under noisy conditions.

This setup provides a highly responsive and efficient communication link between two LoRa systems using a custom SPI configuration, simulating full-duplex functionality.

# Developing the Ground Station Receiver System for CubeSat Telemetry

This section covers the development of the software system for receiving CubeSat telemetry data using the `RadioLib` and `SPI` libraries. The receiver code, [`receiver.ino`](receiver.ino), enables full communication with a LoRa-based CubeSat, forming the core component of our ground station.

### How the Code Works:

The [`receiver.ino`](receiver.ino) file initializes the **LoRa module** (SX1278) using custom SPI pins on the ESP32 and sets the necessary parameters, including frequency, bandwidth, and spreading factor. Once initialized, it begins to **listen for incoming telemetry packets** from the CubeSat.

**Key points in the code:**
- **Custom SPI Pin Configuration:**
   The custom SPI pins for ESP32 are configured as follows:
   - `MOSI (27)`
   - `MISO (19)`
   - `SCK (5)`
   - `NSS (18)`
   - `RST (14)`
   - `DIO0 (26)`
   - `DIO1 (32)`

- **Packet Reception and Data Handling:**
   The system continuously listens for incoming packets and uses the `setFlag()` function to handle received packets. Upon successful reception, it prints important telemetry data such as:
   - **Received data**
   - **RSSI** (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
   - **SNR** (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   - **Frequency error**

- **Error Handling:**
   If a packet is malformed, the system flags a **CRC error**, while other error codes are logged for further debugging.

#### Install Required Libraries:
The necessary libraries, **RadioLib** and **SPI**, are included in the `libraries` folder of this repository. To install them:

- Navigate to the `libraries` folder in the cloned repository.
- Copy the `RadioLib` and `SPI` folders.
- Paste them into your Arduino IDE‚Äôs libraries directory. This is typically located in your Documents under `Arduino/libraries`.

#### Open the Receiver Code:
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to **File** > **Open** and select the `receiver.ino` file from the cloned repository.

#### Select the Correct Board:
In the Arduino IDE:

- Navigate to **Tools** > **Board** and select **ESP32 Dev Module** (or your specific ESP32 variant).

#### Upload the Code:
- Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
- Select the COM port.
- Click on the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE (the right arrow icon).
- Wait for the code to compile and upload to the ESP32.

#### Open the Serial Monitor:
- After uploading, open the Serial Monitor by going to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor** (or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + M`).
- Set the baud rate to `115200` to view the telemetry data being received.

The system will now listen for incoming telemetry packets from the CubeSat, displaying the received data along with key parameters like **RSSI** and **SNR** in the Serial Monitor.
