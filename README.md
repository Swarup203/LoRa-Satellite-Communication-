In this project, we established a ground station using TinyGS with an ESP32 and SX1278 LoRa module. Our custom Arduino code receives telemetry data and visualizes it on the serial plotter, enabling seamless satellite communication. This innovative setup showcases the power of LoRa technology in connecting with orbiting satellites.

# Our Custom Ground Station Hardware Setup
We have developed a custom ground station by soldering an ESP32 and LoRa SX1278 module onto a PCB. Additionally, we have integrated a 0.96-inch OLED display using an I2C connection for easy visualization. This setup is used to receive telemetry data efficiently and enhances the overall communication experience in our Tiny Satellite Ground Station.

# Install

------

#### Setting Up Your Board for the First Time . Just go to https://installer.tinygs.com and follow the instructions there

-----

The first time you flash your board you can use the [web installer](https://installer.tinygs.com) using Google Chrome web browser on Linux, Windows or MacOS. Follow instructions there.

You can also download the latest [release](https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS/releases) and flash it with PlatformIO. If you dont know PlatformIO here you have our [PlatformIO guide](https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS/wiki/Platformio).

Later you can update your Ground Station via [local web OTA or auto update method](https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS/wiki/OTA-Update).

You can also use Arduino IDE, but is a longer and hard path, because you need to install all dependencies. [Arduino guide](https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS/wiki/Arduino-IDE)


# Antenna

To ensure optimal reception and transmission for the ground station, a properly tuned antenna is crucial. For this project, we recommend designing and using a **¬º-wave ground-plane antenna**. The steps involve both setting up the embedded system with the TinyGS firmware and tuning the antenna using a **nanoVNA** (Vector Network Analyzer) for precise measurements.

### Steps:
1. **Install and setup TinyGS firmware** on the ESP32-LoRa embedded system:
   - Follow the steps to install the TinyGS firmware, which enables the ESP32 to communicate with satellites and function as a LoRa ground station.
   - Ensure the ESP32 is properly connected to the LoRa module (SX1278) and all configurations are correct.

2. **Antenna design**:
   - Design a **¬º-wave ground-plane antenna**, ideal for the 433 MHz frequency used by LoRa.
   - The antenna length can be calculated using the formula: 
   **Formula**:
     `L = 300 / (4 * Frequency)`
      
Where:
- `L` is the length of the antenna in meters.
- `Frequency` is the operating frequency in MHz.
- 300 is the speed of light in a vacuum (in megahertz * meters).

## For example, for a frequency of 433 MHz:
 Explanation:
 Wavelength (Œª) of a radio wave is the distance it travels in one cycle and is given by 
ùúÜ=ùëê/ùëì,
where 
c is the speed of light and 
f is the frequency

### For a LoRa system operating at 433 MHz:

  L= 300 / (4 x 433)
  L‚âà (300 / 1732) = **0.173¬†meters** = **17.3¬†cm**
‚Äã

3. **Antenna tuning**:
   - Use a **nanoVNA** to tune the antenna for minimum **SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)**, ensuring it resonates well at the desired frequency.
   - Adjust the radials and main element length as needed to achieve a good match and reduce loss during signal transmission and reception.

### Radiation Pattern of a Dipole Antenna

The radiation pattern of a dipole antenna is crucial for understanding its performance in different directions. A standard half-wave dipole antenna radiates energy in a **doughnut-shaped pattern**, with the strongest radiation occurring perpendicular to the axis of the antenna.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Omnidirectional in the horizontal plane**: The dipole antenna radiates equally in all directions along the horizontal plane, making it effective for long-range communication in all directions.
- **Minimal radiation at the ends**: Along the axis of the dipole (at the tips), the radiation is weakest, meaning that the antenna's performance is reduced in the directions along its length.
- **Figure-eight pattern**: When viewed from the side, the radiation pattern resembles a figure-eight shape, with the strongest lobes perpendicular to the antenna.

This pattern makes dipole antennas ideal for ground station setups where coverage in all horizontal directions is needed, but the vertical direction is less critical.
