# LoRa-Satellite-Communication-
In this project, we established a ground station using TinyGS with an ESP32 and SX1278 LoRa module. Our custom Arduino code receives telemetry data and visualizes it on the serial plotter, enabling seamless satellite communication. This innovative setup showcases the power of LoRa technology in connecting with orbiting satellites.
### Hardware

This project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller paired with the SX1278 LoRa module, providing an efficient solution for satellite communication. It is compatible with a variety of ESP32 development boards, ensuring flexibility in hardware selection.

Currently supported hardware includes:

* **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V1** (433MHz & 863-928MHz versions)
* **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2** (433MHz & 863-928MHz versions)
* **TTGO LoRa32 V1** (433MHz & 868-915MHz versions)
* **TTGO LoRa32 V2** (433MHz & 868-915MHz versions)
* **TTGO LoRa32 V2** (Manually swapped SX1267 to SX1278)
* **T-BEAM + OLED** (433MHz & 868-915MHz versions)
* **T-BEAM V1.0 + OLED**
* **FOSSA 1W Ground Station** (433MHz & 868-915MHz versions)
* **ESP32 dev board + SX126X with crystal** (Custom build, OLED optional)
* **ESP32 dev board + SX126X with TCXO** (Custom build, OLED optional)
* **ESP32 dev board + SX127X** (Custom build, OLED optional)
* **ESP32-S3 150â€“960Mhz - HELTEC LORA32 V3 SX1262**
* **ESP32-S3 433Mhz Custom ESP32-S3 433MHz SX1278**

Additionally, any ESP32 board with an SX1278 module can be configured using templates, allowing for customization to meet specific project requirements.
